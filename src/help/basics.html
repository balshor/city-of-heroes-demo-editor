        <h3><b>What is a demo file?</b></h3>
        <p>A demo file is a specially formatted text file containing instructions for the City of Heroes client to show a predetermined sequence using the game's renderer, models, maps, etc.  These files are usually generated by the client to record actual in-game events.  However, there is no particular reason why demo files cannot instruct the client to show things that did not or cannot happen in the game world.</p>
	<p>Don't think of a demo file as a movie.  A better analogy would be to think of it as a very detailed script that tells a producer (the game engine) which actors to use, how to costume them, where they should stand and move, what they should say, and what sort of actions they should perform.</p>

        <h3><b>How do I record a demo file?</b></h3>
        <p>Use the slash command <code>/demorecord [filename]</code> in game to start recording a demo.  (Here, replace <code>[filename]</code> with the name of the file you wish to save your demo as.  The extension <code>.cohdemo</code> will automatically be appended if none is specified.)  To stop recording, use <code>/demostop</code>.  Demo files will be saved in a subfolder called <code>client_demos</code> of your main City of Heroes folder.</p>

        <h3><b>How do I play a demo file?</b></h3>
        <p>There are a couple different options for this:
            <ul>
                <li>To play a demo, create a new shortcut to the City of Heros program, right-click on it, and select properties.  In the target box, after whatever is already there, add <code>-demoplay</code> (outside the quotes).  You should now be able to drag-and-drop the demo file onto this shortcut to play it.  To stop playback, press <code>ESC</code>.</li>
                <li>You can use a demo launcher, which will automatically pass in the necessary parameters to the City of Heroes client.  This program can also launch demos, using the launch button in the toolbar.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3><b>What does this program do?</b></h3>
        <p>This program is intended to help you edit these demo files in order to instruct the City of Heroes client to show sequences that never actually occurred in game.  This is primarily useful for people interested in making movies and other video clips using the game engine.</p>
