<H1>Basic Editing</h1>
<p>This page describes the use of the buttons on the toolbar of the
individual demo windows.</p>
<a name="editsingle">
<h3>Editing a single lines</h3>
</a>
<p>You can edit a single lines in two ways. First, you can simply
double-click on an entry in the center table. Second, you can select an
entry and make your edits in the Command Information panel in the upper
right corner of the demo window.</p>
<a name="editmultiple">
<h3>Editing multiple lines</h3>
</a>
<p>To edit multiple lines at once, first create one or more filters
so only the lines you want to edit are visible. There are a number of
different operations you can now perform on the visible lines using the
buttons at the top of the demo window:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Delete all</dt>
	<dd>Deletes all visible lines.</dd>
	<dt>Change all</dt>
	<dd>Change all visible lines to have the specified time,
	reference, command, and/or arguments.</dd>
	<dt>Time shift</dt>
	<dd>Adds the number you specify to the time of all visible lines.
	Negative numbers subtract.</dd>
	<dt>Time scale</dt>
	<dd>Compresses or stretches the timespan of the visible lines.
	Times can be scaled so they either fit a defined time range or by a
	fixed ratio.</dd>
	<dt>Translate POS</dt>
	<dd>Adds the numbers you specify to all visible POS lines.
	Negative numbers subtract. This is useful for moving an entire scene
	from one place on a map to another.</dd>

<a name="resort">
<h3>Resorting lines</h3>
<p>The "Resort" button reorders all commands so they appear in
chronological order. The order of commands with at the same time is not
changed. Currently, this command does not sort according to the command

demo to the end of the current demo. The "Export Commands" button will
