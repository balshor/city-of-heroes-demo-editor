<H1>Filters</h1>
<p>Filters are the primary tool that you will use in order to select
demo commands in order to choose which lines that various actions will
affect.</p>
<h3>Adding and removing a filter</h3>
<p>Filters are created using the "Add Filter" button the lower right
corner of the demo window. Clicking on the button will open a dialog box
where you can enter various criteria for the filter to apply. A line of
the demo will "pass" the filter if it matches at least one of the
criteria that you enter on each of the four parts of the filter. (If you
don't enter anything on one of the four parts of the line, it is
ignored.) Lines of the demo that "pass" the filter are either shown or
hidden, depending on which radio button is selected in the dialog.</p>
<p>Once added, a filter can be removed by selecting it and clicking
on the "Remove Filter" button. The "Remove All" button will remove all
filters from the list.</p>
<h3>Applying multiple filters</h3>
<p>Each filter you create is added to the list of filters in the
lower right corner of the demo window. To be visible, a line of the demo
must pass EVERY filter on the list.</p>
<h3>Saving and loading filter lists</h3>
<p>You can save lists of filters to reuse later. Simply click on the
"Save Filters" button and enter a name; the filter list will now be
available later on by clicking on the "Load Filters" button. Your lists
of filters will be accessible from any demo open in the program and will
be saved in the program's configuration for next time you use the
program. You can delete lists of filters from the "Load" dialog.</p>
