<H1>Advanced Editing</h1>
<p>This page describes the wizards that are built into the program.
Theoretically, somebody could develop additional wizard that can be
loaded into the program; however, I consider this a very unlikely
possibility.</p>
<p>Short descriptions of the wizards by clicking on the "Wizards"
button on the main window's toolbar, then highlighting a wizard and
clicking on the "About Wizard" button.</p>
<h3>Interpolation Wizard</h3>
<p>This wizard can create linear, parabolic, or circular movement
paths. (For parametric movement paths, see the "Generate POS/PYR by
formula" wizard.) To use it, select the type of interpolation, then
enter the parameters for the new movement path:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Linear Interpolation</dt>
	<dd>Defines a straight-line path from the start to the end points.
	Can also generate PYR commands for a constant-rate-of-turn from the
	start PYR to the end PYR.</dd>
	<dt>Parabolic Interpolation</dt>
	<dd>Defines a parabolic path from the start to the end points with
	the specified max height. Useful for creating jumps.</dd>
	<dt>Circular Interpolation</dt>
	<dd>Defines a circular path starting at the given point and
	rotating around the specified center. Can generate either horizontal or
	vertical circles. Note that you can specify fractional revolutions for
	less than a full circle.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Smart Cut Wizard</h3>
<p>This wizard attempts to remove all commands in the specified time
range while retaining the matching NEW/DEL and FX/FXDESTROY pairs. It
can also keep the last MOV or POS/PYR commands in the block. Note that
this wizard can take a while to process the commands; a progress bar
will be coming in a future version.</p>
<h3>Costume Import/Export Wizard</h3>
<p>This wizard will copy costumes from one demo to another. (A
costume is defined by COSTUME, NPC, and PARTSNAME commands.) Simply
choose the source demo, reference number, and NEW command (in case
multiple costumes are defined for one reference) and the same three
things for the target.</p>
<h3>Fix Ghosts Wizard</h3>
<p>Occasionally, demos will have commands for references that have
already been deleted (via a DEL command). These commands can make the
reference reappear in the demo after it should have disappeared. This
wizard will automatically remove these "ghost" commands.
<h3>Generate PYR relative to POS</h3>
<p>This command can automatically generate PYR commands based on the
POS commands already in the demo. There are two options for how these
commands will be generated:</
<dl>
	<dt>by movement path</dt>
	<dd>This mode points the reference in the direction of its
	movement. This allows you to create a POS movement path (with the
	Interpolation wizard, for example) without worrying about creating the
	PYR commands.</dd>
	<dt>by another reference</dt>
	<dd>This mode points the reference at another reference. This is
	useful for doing things like having a moving camera track a moving
	reference.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fixed offsets can be added in either mode, which will cause the
PYR commands to point off-target. This allows you to point the camera at
a character, but have the character in the right half of the screen, for
example.</p>
<h3>Generate POS/PYR by formula</h3>
<p>This wizard allows you to generate POS and PYR commands
parametrically (ie, by formula). The formula parser understands a
reasonably good number of mathematical functions, including
trigonometry. This wizard is for people very comfortable with
mathematics.</p>
<h3>Large-File Filter Wizard</h3>
<p>Occasionally, you may need to work with an extremely large demo
file. Normally, the editor loads an entire file into memory before you
can manipulate it. With this wizard, you can establish a set a filters
and run a large file through it without loading the entire file at once.
For example, if you have a two-hour demo file and only want to extract
the costume commands, you can set filters to extract all COSTUME and
PARTSNAME lines. These will be loaded into a new demo.</p>
<h3>Extract Movement Path</h3>
<p>This wizard extracts movement paths from specially recorded
demos. The idea is that movement paths can be difficult to create
outside of CoH, so we'll just run a character through several movement
paths in the game and record his movements. The character will send
himself a different tell in-game to indicate the start and end of each
movement path. (This allows a player to record multiple movement paths
in a single demo.) The extracted paths will be placed in separate new
demos.</p>
<h3>CAM Coordinate Wizard</h3>
<p>One of the annoyances of working with demo files is that the
camera (CAM reference) uses a different PYR frame from normal
characters. So, a list of PYR commands for a character cannot be simply
copied over to the CAM reference for use by the camera. This wizard
converts the CAM PYR coordinates between the standard and CAM frames of
reference. (The conversion is self-inverting, so run the wizard twice to
undo it.)</p>
<h3>Command Stripping Wizard</h3>
<p>By default, demos record a lot of textual information that you
may not want appearing in your demo. Examples include player names, chat
bubbles, damage numbers, etc. This wizard can strip these commands out
of the demo for you.</p>
<h3>POS Analysis Wizard</h3>
<p>This is a simple wizard I wrote that will determine the minimum
and maximum for each of the POS coordinates in the demo. This is mostly
useful to determine how much physical space is being used in the virtual
world.</p>
<h3>Dummy Player Wizard</h3>
<p>For efficiency reasons, the game engine only renders video and
sound in a certain radius around the player. Who the player is is
determined by the "Player" command. This can be annoying if you move the
camera or delete the PC. This wizard will create an invisible NPC,
designate it as the player, and have it shadow the camera around. Thus,
the action around the camera is always rendered.</p>
<h3>Embedded Feedback Wizard</h3>
<p>It can be difficult figuring out which reference belongs to each
character in the demo. This wizard will add chat spam so each reference
will shout out its reference number. They can also shout out the current
time, so you can identify the pieces of the demo with interesting
action. If you want to be able to automatically remove this chat spam
later, include a unique chat suffix so the wizard can identify which
chat messages are the spam.</p>
<h3>Vanity Demo Creation Wizard</h3>
<p>After editing a costume, you may want to make sure that it looks
like what you want in the game. This wizard will extract the costume,
stick your character on Ms. Liberty's platform in Atlas Park, and give
you a 360 degree view of what your character is wearing. You can use
this as a tool for editing demos or for inflating your ego.</p>
